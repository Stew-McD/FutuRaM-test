This site will be continuously updated as the codebase evolves. 

This model is a part of the FutuRaM project, which is a project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. 

See the official `project website <https://www.futuram.eu>`_ for more information 

The main GitHub repository for the model is `here <https://github.com/FutuRaM-Project/IntegratedModel>`_ 

Goal and scope of the model
----------------------------

The goal of the model is to simulate the recovery of secondary raw materials (SRMs) from waste streams in the EU. 

Inputs to the model include: 

- Waste streams: composition and amount 
- Recovery processes: details about their operation and efficiency 
- Flowsheet: how the waste streams are processed in the recovery processes 
- Future scenarios: how the waste streams and recovery processes will change in the future under three scenarios 

Outputs from the model include: 

- Recovery of SRMs (composition and amount) from waste streams from 2025 to 2050 under three scenarios 
- Impacts of the recovery of SRMs on the environment, human health, society, and economy
